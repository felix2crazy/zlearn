//Number 1
var numA = 6; var numB = 7;
numA + numB;
// This program above adds 6 + 7 and returns answer 13


//Number 2
function takehiro(a,b){
	console.log (a + b);
	return 2 + (a + b)
}
//the function above adds two numbers

//Number 3
function adder(param){
	console.log(a + param);
	return a + param
}
//The function above is wrong because "a" was not defined.
//But if "a" was defined before hand then the answer would return twice due to the return statement.
